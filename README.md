# Handling Null Values in JavaScript Function

This example shows a common error in JavaScript: unexpected behavior when null values are passed as function arguments.  The `foo` function demonstrates a best practice for handling nulls explicitly.

## Bug
The bug is that the original function may not handle `null` values gracefully, which could lead to unexpected results or errors, such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'property')` if you attempt to access properties of the null objects.  The provided code fixes this using explicit null checks.

## Solution
The solution involves adding an explicit check for `null` values at the beginning of the function, returning `null` if either `a` or `b` is `null`.  This prevents errors and clarifies the function's behavior.
